## I. INTRODUCTION

Camera Calibration is one of the most time consuming but
significant process for any computer vision research involving
3D geometry, of which robotics research is a very prime example. An automatic way to perform efficient and robust camera
calibration was provided by Zhengyou Zhang of Microsoft.
In this report is summarized the implementation of Zhangâ€™s
technique for calibration.
